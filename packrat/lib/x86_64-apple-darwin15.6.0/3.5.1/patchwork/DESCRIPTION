Description: The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong API for
    sequentially building up a plot, but does not concern itself with
    composition of multiple plots. 'patchwork' is a package that
    expands the API to allow for arbitrarily complex composition of
    plots by providing mathmatical operators for combining multiple
    plots. Other packages that addresses this need (but with a
    different approach) are 'gridExtra' and 'cowplot'.
